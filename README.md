# Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting
Forecasted stock prices and FX rates using ARIMA and Prophet models. Generated predictions with confidence intervals to support data-driven financial decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting **financial time series data** such as stock prices, cryptocurrency rates, and forex values.  
The goal is to build models that can generate **future predictions with confidence intervals** to support **data-driven financial decision-making**.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of historical financial datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization of price trends  
- Time series forecasting using:
  - **ARIMA** (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)  
  - **Facebook Prophet**  
- Evaluation of prediction accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE  
- Visualization of forecasted values along with confidence intervals  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from **Kaggle**:
- Example: [Stock Market Data / Cryptocurrency Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Supports CSV files containing columns like:
